The primary objective of my research is to inform efforts aimed at reducing race/ethnic health inequalities that characterize our growing older adult population.

Their higher prevalence of diabetes is largely understood as a product of individual-level health behaviors without much attention given to how the various adverse social factors, social disadvantages, and social inequalities influence the disease process.

Puerto Ricans have experienced compounding environmental disasters in the last 10 years, have a crumbling health care infrastructure, and are in a debt crisis that may be negatively affecting the health and quality of life of older Puerto Ricans. Due to data limitations, relatively little is known about the health and aging experiences of older adults on the island.
