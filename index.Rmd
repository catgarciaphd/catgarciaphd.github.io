Welcome! I am an assistant professor of sociology and a core faculty member of the Minority Health Disparities Initiative at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. I received my PhD in Gerontology from the University of Southern California in 2020. 

I study Latina/o/x aging and health in the United States and Puerto Rico. I am broadly interested in how residential environments, sociocultural factors, and other social factors shape the disease process among older adults.

I previously earned my M.S. in Sociology from Florida State University and B.A. in Sociology with a minor in Human Complex Systems from the University of California - Los Angeles.
