Taiguey (Good day in the Taino language)! I am an assistant professor of sociology and a core faculty member of the Minority Health Disparities Initiative at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. As a gerontologist, I apply a combined intersectionality and life-course perspective to contextualize what mechanisms account for the heterogeneity in health and mortality outcomes among older Latina/o/x subgroups. My research is inherently interdisciplinary and is grounded in sociology, biology, psychology, and policy.
